DeepGlass Demos
Constitutive Identity for the Post-Quantum World
"I am me and it agrees."

What Is DeepGlass?
DeepGlass is a new approach to identity verification—one where the person becomes the credential.
Today's identity systems are built on things that can be stolen, guessed, or faked: passwords, security questions, documents, even biometrics. The first lie is free—anyone can claim to be anyone, and most systems simply believe them.
DeepGlass inverts this model. Instead of credentials about you, the credential is you. Constitutive identity rooted in what cannot be forged: your unique biological signature, secured with post-quantum cryptography.

The Demos
These interactive demonstrations let you feel the difference between the broken world of descriptive identity and the future of constitutive identity.

How to Experience

Open on your phone
Tap through each screen
Try lying first—see how easy it is
Then tell the truth—see how it feels to be recognized


The Problem

Passwords can be stolen
Security questions can be guessed
Documents can be forged
Biometrics can be synthesized
The first lie is always free

The Solution

Your identity is written in your body
It cannot be copied, stolen, or faked
DeepGlass creates a cryptographic signature from what you are
The system doesn't believe you—it recognizes you


Technical Foundation
DeepGlass leverages:

Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) — The secure enclave already in your phone
Post-Quantum Cryptography — Protection against future quantum attacks
Genomic Identity Triangulation — Multiple independent markers, not single points of failure
Constraint Intractability — Trillion-dollar forgery costs


Status

Patents filed: January 2026
